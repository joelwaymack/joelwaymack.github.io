Every developer is on a continuos, life-long journey toward software development mastery. Whether you're a manager looking to build a great career track for your employees, or you're a developer trying to think through how to progress in your career, we all need to consider what expert software development skills look like and how we, or the people work with, can progress toward that expertise.

## Dreyfus Skill Acquisition Model

One simple description of skill levels comes from the [Dreyfus model of skill acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition). In this model, an individual progresses through various stages in skill aquisition until they acheive expertise or mastery in that skill. Here is a short description of each level in the Dreyfus model:

1. **Novice** - Follow strict rules and guidelines without understanding the broader context. Rely heavily on instructions and have little to no experience with the skill.
1. **Advanced Beginner** - Have some experience and can recognize recurring patterns. Rely on rules but begin to apply them to specific situations.
1. **Competent** - Can plan and make decisions based on experience. Can prioritize tasks and manage time effectively while still relying on rules and guidelines.
1. **Proficient** - Have a deeper understanding of the skill and can see the big picture. Make decisions based on intuition and experience, rather than just rules.
1. **Expert** - Have an intuitive grasp of the skill and can perform tasks effortlessly. Can make decisions quickly and accurately, often without conscious thought.

As someone moves up the levels toward expertise, rote rules turn into intuitive leadings that are no longer conscious actions. If you've ever pair programmed (in all honesty, simply sat and watched) an expert level programmer crank out code, you've probably seen this expert level skill at work. They get into the zone and what seems to flow effortlessly from their fingertips is both elegant and efficient.

When I started my first job at Boeing, the very first task I was given was to add some processing to find and return a value in an array for some flight processing software. I spent hours writing a for-loop and ensuring what I was writing was correct. I thought through all of the rules that I knew and eventually got a solution that worked correctly after I applied those rules. Coming out of college and an internship, I was squarely in the advanced beginner stage of software development skill acquisition. I could recognize the pattern (searching through an array) and the rule to utilize (a for loop) but it took me a painstakingly long time to apply it (8 hours).

Now, if I had that same task in one of my primary languages, it would take less than five minutes, even if it was a brand new code base, and I wouldn't even think about what I was doing. I've moved, in this regard, from the advanced beginner to the expert stage of skill acquisition. That's the hope for everyone who is progressing in their software development journey.

## The Expert Beginner - A Cautionary Tale

One of the [best expansions I've read](https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/) on the Dreyfus model is the insertion of another terminal level after advanced beginner: the dreaded **Expert Beginner**.

Expert beginners are those developers who understand, like an advanced beginner, a limited set of rules and how to apply them in a specific situation, but have mistaken this skill level for expertise and have never moved beyond it. I've worked with a lot of expert beginners over the course of my career.

Recently I was working with a "senior developer" who was learning a new technology. As I was guiding him in building out his application, over and over he'd ask basic programming questions about the language and framework we were using. Though he was the senior most developer on the team, when I worked with other developers on the same team, I found that they were higher in the skill acquisition model.

Expert beginners fail to progess because they get comfortable with the set of rules they know and refuse to move outside of that boundary. Often you find that expert beginners have been on the same team for 10+ years for fear of moving and having to expand the patterns that they know how to apply.

There is a common phrase in software development that applies to expert beginners:
> You can have 20 years of experience or 1 year of experience 20 times.

Please don't fall into, or let your team members stay in, the expert beginner black hole.

The best way to move beyond the expert beginner level is to honestly assess where you are (and where you've been). No one can stay an expert beginner when they realize they're in that hole and decide to learn and grow.

## Breaking Down the Skills

So far, we've treated software development as a singular skill. That can be helpful conceptually, but in reality, software development is a conglomeration of skills.

A few years ago I helped build a software engineering organization from 120 to 250 engineers. One of the most important things I did was map out skill expectations for each level in our engineering organization. To do this, I had to consider what constitutent skills are required to make a good software developer and then help build out what each of those skills looks like at each skill level. This almost always ends up as a matrix for mapping skills with level expectations.

While each organization is slightly different, there are certain skills that always fall into the software development skill bucket. Here are the ones I think about:

- **Languages and Frameworks** - The languages and frameworks being used, including testing frameworks.
- **Software Design and Architecture** - How to design software inside a distinct deployable unit (an API or App) and how you would test it.
- **Platform Design and Architecture** - How to design all the deployable components to work together, often using a cloud provider. I generally lump databases and messaging systems into this.
- **Tooling and Process** - The source code repository, build and deployment systems, and how the team, and organization, work to deliver functionality.
- **Communication and Teamwork** - Effectively communicating internally and externally on a team alongside supporting team members as they need help.
- **Continous Learning** - Learning about the industry and technology to bring new ideas to bear.
